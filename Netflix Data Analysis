# Objective: Create a DataFrame from scratch, to analyze the length of Netflix movies over the years. Hypothesis: Lengths of movies on Netflix are decreasing over time. 

# Create the years and durations lists
years = [2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020]
durations = [103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, 90]

# Create a dictionary with the two lists
movie_dict = {"years":years, "durations": durations}

# Print the dictionary
print(movie_dict)

# Import pandas under its usual alias
import pandas as pd

# Create a dataframe
durations_df = pd.DataFrame(movie_dict)

# Print the DataFrame
print(durations_df)

# Visualize the data
